Example code for the "Regression approaches for modelling genotype-environment interaction and making predictions into a target population of environments" paper.

# Important note
Please have a look at the `Example models.R`. The `Dataset simulation.R`, and `Support functions for the variance.R` are called from within that file.
`CV example.R` is not meant to be executed, but to show in details how the CV was done.
