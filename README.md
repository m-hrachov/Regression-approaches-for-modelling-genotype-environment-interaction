# Regression-approaches-for-modelling-genotype-environment-interaction-
Example code for the "Regression approaches for modelling genotype-environment interaction and making predictions into a target population of environments" paper.

# Important note
Please have a look at the `Example models.R`. The `Dataset simulation.R`, and `Support functions for the variance.R` are called from within that file.
`CV example.R` is not meant to be executed, but to show in details how the CV was done.

File `Proof that asreml C_inv is similar to ours.R` goes with its own dataset `simulated_dataset_for_C_inv.RData`. This dataset closer mimics the actual data and CV used in the paper.
